      Reiki can take you further into a deeper state of connection while Yoga empowers you to find balance.

        As we are travelling through life, we might be stumbling upon more questions than answers. Asking ourselves “Who am I? What is my purpose? What does it all mean?”. With time and experiences, a detachment from what is expected of us can happen, leaving more space for inquiry. The process might be frustrating, or even isolating.
        <br /><br />
        You are not alone.
        <br /><br />
        I don't have all the answers but I can relate to the feeling. With the practice of Reiki and Yoga, I navigate between awkward and playful discoveries with my body and mind. Through meditation, breath and movement, I am noticing that I am getting to know and love myself more. I am finally learning to accept myself physically, mentally and spiritually. 
        <br /><br />
        Once we are truly at ease with ourselves, we live beaming with gratitude and serenity. We grow, we nurture, and we blossom.

              <h4>Is Reiki for me?</h4>
              <p>
                Reiki isn't the simple answer to all your problems. The benefits of Reiki can range from helping with stress, insomnia, trauma, chronic pain to energy blockages, fatigue, foggy brain, depression, however there's more. Reiki can also shake your life, your habits, your energy level, your mood, your ability to say no. Most importantly, Reiki is a non-invasive, non-addictive energy healing technique that is a beautiful complement to any other kind of treatment (traditional medicine, naturopathy, nutrition, counselling, osteopathy, remedial massage etc).
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>How does Reiki feel?</h4>
              <p>
                Reiki can be translated from the Japanese, where it traditionally comes from, to “spiritually guided life force energy”. During a session, Reiki practitioners act as a channel, tuning into this energy and guiding it in your body. Receiving Reiki can be quite an experience, the recipient usually feels warmth and tingling, and then leaves the session feeling relaxed.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>Managing expectations</h4>
              <p>
                When you book a healing session with me, I always ensure you know what to expect. I will give you some information about the practice and will happily answer any questions that may arise. After the session, whether you opt for a distance Reiki treatment or hands-on-healing (in person), there will be space to share about your experience. A follow-up might be booked for free to chat further about tools and techniques to empower you in your journey. This might include chakras meditation, breathwork, movement, mantra etc.

              <h4>Is Yoga for me?</h4>
              <p>
                Originating from India, The word Yoga comes from the Sanskrit “Yoke”, meaning “union”. The physical practice, commonly shared in the West, serves as a preparation to sit. Once the body has moved, the mind can find quietness.
                <br />
                Breathing exercises, mantra recitations and different meditations are all part of a Yoga practice so Yoga is accessible to everyone. The aim is to calm the fluctuation of the mind by uniting body and mind.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>How does Yoga feel?</h4>
              <p>
                Exploring shapes the body can make can range from intimidating to exhilarating. During a practice, the invitation is to enquire how the mind is reacting, learning to unravel negative habits and rather fall into the awareness of the present moment.
                <br />
                Mindfulness, the gift of Yoga, is then practiced outside of the mat and leads to better stress management, focus, productivity and beautiful connection to self & others.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h4>Managing expectations</h4>
              <p>
                When booking for a private or a group session, I focus on a few things: 
                <br />* <b>accessibility</b> (experience, age, gender, ability...): we workshop what works best for you.
                <br />* <b>agency / trauma informed</b>: with invitations and guidance, you are in control of your practice. Hands-on modifications are always optional.
                <br />* <b>cultural appreciation</b>: learning and sharing all aspects of Yoga from its roots, mythology and different tools & practices.

                My name is Marion and some call me Cherry :)
                <br />
                I completed an associate diploma in Animal and Human Behaviour in France in 2011 and loved learning about Physiology and Neuro-Biology. After my studies, I travelled for a year, opening up to other cultures, slowing down and enjoying the richness of life and discovering Yoga. I also discovered that I was more interested in participating in people's happiness, so I went back to school and did an apprenticeship in... pastry! Smells, colours, flavours, textures... <b>Using the senses is an amazing way to be present</b>.
                <br /><br />
                I landed in Australia in 2015, falling in love with the vibrant, multicultural and vegan-friendly Melbourne and its inner north suburbs. I worked in hospitality, marketing, and admin to fund multiple trainings in Reiki, different styles of Yoga, Breathwork, Sound Healing. After a few additional years of practice, I felt ready to share with others and in 2019 Cherry Healing was born.
                <br />
                My mission is to accompany you to <b>allow the energy to flow, for you to blossom and to grow</b>.
